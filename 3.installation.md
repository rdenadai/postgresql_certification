# Installation

## OS User and Permission

By default 2 users called `postgres` are created, one at the OS level and another at the database level, different users of course, but same name.

On the installation, also, install the `contrib` package (or check if it's possible to install it). `contrib` provide extra features to postgresql that aren't still integrated on the main version.

## Connecting to a database

```bash
$> su - postgres
```

Change the authentication method to md5 in `pg_hba.conf` and reload the server.

```bash
$> nvim /var/lib/psql/<version>/data/pg_hba.conf
$> /usr/psql-<version>/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/psql/<version>/data/ reload
```
